## Introduction

Welcome to the High-Level Programming with Python repository! This repository is dedicated to my learning journey in high-level programming using the Python programming language.

Python is a versatile and powerful programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It offers a wide range of libraries and frameworks that make it suitable for various applications such as web development, data analysis, machine learning, and more.

In this repository, you will find projects and tasks that cover different aspects of high-level programming with Python, including fundamental concepts, data structures, algorithms, object-oriented programming, web development, and database management.

## About

If you are new to Python programming, start by checking out the Getting Started guide. It will help you set up your development environment and provide basic information about the language.

This repository contains the following topics:

- Python basics
- Data structures
- Algorithms
- Object-oriented programming
- Web development
- Databases
- JavaScript

## Contents

The folders and files contain exercises and projects on topics like:

- **Basics**: Print statement, variables, data types, operators, conditions, loops, functions
- **Data Structures**: Lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries
- **OOP**: Classes, inheritance, encapsulation
- **Web Dev**: HTTP, APIs, scraping
- **SQL**: Introduction, advanced queries
- **and more!**
